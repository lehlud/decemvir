# Decemvir

An application for document and note management written in flutter.

To take notes, Decemvir uses Markdown.
Each note must reside in a document, which in turn must reside in a database. However, such a database can also be contained in a document.

## plans

- encryption (also with fingerprint sensors) in the future
- synchronisation with nextcloud (and google drive and iCloud and Network drives and and and)
